## Agenda

### Announcements

*Extracted from **cross-project-council-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **openjs-foundation org** prior to the meeting.

### openjs-foundation/standards

* Standards Group Participation at OpenJS World  [#205](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/issues/205)

* Concise Guide to Participating in Web Standards Document WIP [#190](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/issues/190)

* Define terms for SME Participation [#173](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/issues/173)

## Q&A, Other

* Is there interest &/or potential resourcing available to help standardize [SemVer](https://semver.org/) as a Web API? (ref. https://github.com/nodejs/tooling/issues/146) ~ @darcyclarke
  * Is this the right venue? If not, where should this be brought?
  * This proposal was originally brought to the Node.js Tooling WG but there’s limited availability & OpenJSF has access to/connections with ECMA, W3C, OSI etc.
  * Various pieces of feedback have been given about where the implementation could/should live (runtime/web api etc.)
  * Scope of this functionality may be limited to the 2.0.0 schema & corresponding comparators (may not be 1:1 with “node-semver” - as that expands on range comparators)
